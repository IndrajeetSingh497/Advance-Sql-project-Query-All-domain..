# Advance-Sql-Queries-for-different-domain
# 📊 Advance SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🔎 Overview

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts that demonstrate real-world business analysis techniques. Each script focuses on a different analytical approach—such as segmentation, ranking, performance tracking, and trend analysis—and shows how these methods are applied across industries like Retail & E-commerce, Finance & Banking, Marketing & Strategy, and Operations & Supply Chain.
The goal of this project is to build a reusable library of SQL queries that are commonly used by data analysts, BI teams, and decision-makers to extract insights and drive business value.
